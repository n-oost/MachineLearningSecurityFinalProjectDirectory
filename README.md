# Machine Learning Security Project

This project is organized into the following phases:

1. **Dataset Selection and Preprocessing**
   - Select a suitable dataset (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, or domain-relevant)
   - Implement preprocessing: normalization, train-test split (70-30)

2. **Building a Machine Learning Model**
   - Choose a model architecture (DNN, CNN, etc.)
   - Train on clean data with early stopping
   - Evaluate with accuracy and confusion matrix

3. **Training-Time Attacks (Data Poisoning)**
   - Implement data poisoning attacks

4. **Defending Against Data Poisoning and Adversarial Attacks**
   - Develop and test defense strategies

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, tensorflow or pytorch

## Structure
- `data/` — Datasets and preprocessing scripts
- `models/` — Model architectures and training scripts
- `attacks/` — Data poisoning and adversarial attack scripts
- `defenses/` — Defense mechanisms
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Follow phase instructions in each folder.
